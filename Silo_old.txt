'''Silo''' (part i of mission 3: Kirghzistan) is the sixth level in [[GoldenEye 007]]. The formal name for this level is Soviet Missile Launch Silo #4. This level features a countdown timer; all objectives must be cleared and the end of the level reached before the timer elapses.

== Overview ==

Bond must make his way to the end of the level before the countdown finishes. It is required to take a picture of the satellite. 00 Agent and higher difficulties must place explosives in the main rooms, and will benefit from [[Pause#Quick Pause|quick pausing]].

There is some variation with how accurately the countdown timer syncs to the [[In-Game_Timer|in-game timer]].

There are 6 guards who are completely inactive until you reach a certain height value, which they are always checking for. Afterwards, they become normal guards. I'm pretty sure these are the ones near Ouromov.

All crate guards are targeting guards.
