== Facts ==

=== Grenade odds ===

The grenade odds for spawning guards are commonly misquoted as 11/256 = 4.3% or 1 in 23, but there is a further ~75% RNG roll which brings the odds down to close to 1 in 31. 

=== Radio explosion chance from table ===
When shooting out the table, sometimes the radios will jump into the air. Depending on the amount of height gained these will fall enough to be damaged for a fast A completion.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://forums.the-elite.net/index.php?topic=18518.msg384131#msg384131|title=the-elite facts topic post on fast radio damage|access-date=July 16, 2021}}</ref>

== Strategies ==

=== Leaned mine throw ===

On Agent difficulty, the mine can be thrown from quite far away using a [[R-Lean|leaned]] throw. It goes through the wall like on Control. What gives it the distance is throwing it on the slope. If you time the throw as you go up a slope + the forward momentum, it gets much more air than on a level ground. The timing for the detonation needs to be precise.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://forums.the-elite.net/index.php?topic=18518.msg400759#msg400759|title=the-elite facts topic Boss on leaned throw|access-date=July 16, 2021}}</ref>
