'''G5 Building: Reconnaissance''' is the sixth level in [[Perfect Dark]].

Several techniques are used on all three difficulty settings on this level.

* At the start of a level it's quicker to pause and select the Falcon than just to wait for it to come out manually. This technique is most famously exploited on the Duel mission.
* Only a few guards actually run for and try to activate alarms - some of these can be avoided, saving the trouble of shooting them.
* The method of letting the safe unlock (and swing open) during the intermediate cutscene is well-known; indeed, needed to earn the cheat on Agent, but saves time on all settings.
