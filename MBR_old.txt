'''Mr. Blonde's Revenge''' (usually known as '''MBR''') is [[Perfect Dark]]'s 18th level, and first special mission. Chronologically it actually takes place roughly between [[Deep Sea]] and [[Attack Ship]] (i.e. at about the same time as [[CI]]).

===General advice===

Regardless of how much of the opening cinema you sit through, there's still a short time before the lift arrives, so mistakes in the first part of the level don't matter much.
